    <h1 class="blog-title">Communication skills != Ease of communication</h1>
		<p class="blog-date">17th of January, 2023</p>

    <p>Once I had a candidate who wasn't the best at presenting his expertise in an online interview and didn't have the best communication skills. And yet he got the job. Why? Because his internet connection was perfect, the lighting was in place, he had a good microphone, and there wasn't lag at all on his end. And it felt like the candidate was sitting right in front of you. He answered all the questions correctly, was interviewed without any complications, and got the job. There was no effort to communicate with him considering that he seemed very shy and talked much less than he should for the role he was interviewed for.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, I had a candidate who was the guy that I would hire myself if I was the hiring manager. His communication and presentation skills were the best I've seen in a long time. And he got rejected in the first round. Why? Because the employer had a really tough time interviewing the candidate because there was a lag non-stop during the call. The HR manager didn't bother to continue the process as there were a lot of other candidates to be interviewed already.</p>

    <p>Note that both of the candidates were qualified for the job they were interviewed for.</p>

    <p>The moral of the story: buy a good webcam!</p>
