    <h1 class="blog-title">Make Your Profile Attractive to Recruiters and HR Managers - George’s Quick Checklist</h1>
		<p class="blog-date">15th of April, 2023</p>

    <p>Here's a checklist of things to take care of before starting to look for a new job. The things in this list make you more approachable to recruiters and HR managers.</p>

    <h2>A Complete LinkedIn profile</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A good headline: Make sure you specify your exact title and the tech that you're using (e.g. "Full-Stack MERN Developer" or "Backend Developer | Node.js and Express.js"). Just like doing SEO for websites make sure you do SEO for your LinkedIn profile.</li>

      <li>Updated job preferences</li>

      <li>Summary: In summary, you should map every tech stack that you have experience in and write how many years of experience (or months) in every single technology you have. This includes frameworks and libraries relevant to the role you're looking to apply.</li>

      <li>Updated experience section: Every role in the experience section should have the following piece of information:</li>

      <ul>

        <li>Name of the company with a working link: Many developers put a company name without a working link and the recruiter/HR manager thinks the company is fake or the candidate is hiding something on purpose. Doesn't look good definitely!</li>

        <li>Skills used in a specific role: There's a separate option for this.</li>

        <li>In the description of the role held: Responsibilities held, technologies used, projects worked on, and team structure. Many developers don't include this and HRs don't bother to try to find relevant info about the candidate because the info is inaccessible without putting extra effort into it and contacting a recruiter or the candidate directly to obtain the info.</li>

      </ul>

      <li>Updated skills section: Make sure you put your tech first, ideally a framework! So if you're a JS dev → React.js, Next.js & Express.js go first, for example.</li>

      <li>Spoken languages! Specify the languages you know, no matter the proficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A well-formated resume</h2>

      <p>There are a lot of resources on this, but the general rule of thumb is to make it short and sweet, ideally one page long.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Most of the advice stated above is usable for your CV as well.</li>

        <li>Make sure you have all the contact info, especially your working LinkedIn profile link! You will be surprised how many developers don't include this in their CVs.</li>

        <li>Please make your CV readable and well-formatted. I can't present you to the company with a bad format! My notes about you that I sent to the HR will unfortunately not compensate for it!</li>

        <li>Emphasize responsibilities held, technologies used, projects worked on, and team structure for each role held, as on your LinkedIn profile.</li>

        <li>If you have a German work permit or EU citizenship, explain that in the CV as well (assuming that you're not a German citizen)</li>

        <li>GitHub: Having a GitHub profile link is also nice :)</li>

      </ul>
