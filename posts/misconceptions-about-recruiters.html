    <h1 class="blog-title">4 Misconceptions About Recruiters From a Candidateâ€™s Perspective</h1>
		<p class="blog-date">31st of January, 2023</p>

    <p>Here's a list covering some misconceptions about recruiters in no particular order.</p>

    <h2>My salary is going to be different/cut when I get a job through a recruiter</h2> 

    <p>No, it's not. Companies have a separate budget for cooperating with recruiters. They usually pay us after the hire is made and when the candidate stays inside the company for some agreed amount of time. That's called a "guarantee period" for the candidate. A guarantee period is agreed upon before a company that hires and a recruiting agency start to work together.</p>

    <p>Your salary stays the same, no matter if you get a job through a recruiter or not. This is how most recruiting agencies work.</p>

    <h2>Recruiters don't really do anything. Why not apply directly to the company?</h2>

    <p>Because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We have inside info that you won't get by applying directly. We often know more about the hiring process than the HR manager does.</li>
      <li>We know what the company is looking for, so if we reached out to you we believe that you're a fit. So less time to research on your end.</li>
      <li>We can give you immediate feedback on your application so we can fix any potential issues that would otherwise have you rejected by HR. We present you to the company better so we increase your chances of getting hired.</li>
      <li>We are on your side. Although minimal, we have a slight chance of influencing the company to hire you.</li>
      <li>Even if you're rejected, we can ask for more detailed feedback from HR that would otherwise not bother to give it.</li>
      <li>We (sometimes) even have a technical background ourselves (I was a software developer before transitioning to tech recruitment) so we can perfectly understand the technical aspect of the role we're recruiting for.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>All recruiters are the same</h2>

    <p>Most of them are. I actually agree on this one. Recruiting in a recruiting agency is easier to do than business development, so recruiters are sometimes outsourced and more often than not underpaid. Sometimes, a recruiter gets a role that is nearly impossible to fill and is forced to fill the role's pipeline with candidates. As a result, recruiters choose quantity over quality. And you get generic spam in your inbox because the recruiter needs to show something to his/her boss.</p>

    <h2>Recruiting is a close profession to the HR</h2>

    <p><u>Recruiting = Sales</u></p>

    <p>Period.</p>

    <p>In classical sales, you have a product and you need to sell it. Simple(r).</p>

    <p>In recruiting, we need to sell you the opportunity. You're being approached by other recruiters as well, so we need to make our offer and approach as good as possible. Then we need to sell your profile to our client company and convince them to choose your profile and not the profile of the competition. Companies work with multiple recruiting agencies and often give them the same roles to fill. And before we even approach you, we need to sell ourselves to the client company and convince them to choose us as their recruitment agency. It is sales, and it's a tough profession to be in!</p>
