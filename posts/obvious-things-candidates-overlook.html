    <h1 class="blog-title">The Obvious Things Tech Candidates Overlook When Interviewing for a Job in Germany</h1>
		<p class="blog-date">23rd of August, 2023</p>

    <p>There are a couple of things that are very important to hiring managers and me when talking to a candidate. Although every single candidate is unique, there are some obvious things they overlook. Here's a list in no particular order.</p>

    <h2>Willingness to relocate to Germany</h2>

    <p>Skip this one if you already live in Germany.</p>

    <p>This may be the obvious one. But it isn't. If you want to get a job in Germany working with a recruiter you must be willing to relocate. (duh!)</p>

    <p>Companies hire recruiters for one reason: they can't find people on their own. If they want to hire contractors or freelancers they have the whole world at their disposal. Therefore they don't usually need external help. Of course, some recruiters do specialize in finding contractors and freelancers, but I'm not one of them and most people aren't.</p>

    <p>I get a lot of requests on LinkedIn from devs wanting a job in Germany and a lot of them want to work from their origin country. And not many of them are German/EU citizens. Even If I get a remote role, 99% of the time the role is remote only in Germany and the EU.</p>

    <p>And speaking of the European Union...</p>

    <h2>EU citizenship (if you're willing to relocate)</h2>

    <p>If you're an EU citizen there's less paperwork to be done by the employer, meaning less money, time, effort, and stress. The first thing German companies often do if they can't find devs in Germany is that they start to look in the EU.</p>

    <p>Not every company offers visa support. And the ones that do usually look for very niche talent.</p>

    <h2>German language</h2>

    <p>If you happen to know German before relocating to Germany that's awesome! But to be considered a German speaker, you need to have at least a B2 certification.</p>

    <p>A B2 certified level is something that companies consider "good enough". My rule of thumb is this: if you're comfortable having an interview in the German language, you're good to go. And get the certification. It's worth it.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that when you start to live in Germany that still doesn't mean you should relax. If you plan to stay there long term, my advice is to learn German as much as possible. Getting a job without a single word of German is definitely possible, but you'll have a lot more options if you know how to speak the language.</p>

    <h2>English language</h2>

    <p>No German? Shouldn't be a problem if you know how to speak good English.</p>

    <p>And by English, I mean that your communication skills are maxed out. Not only the language but the way you present yourself. Devs by default know this language very well but often fail to communicate their expertise with the HR manager.</p>

    <p>Many people think they know English perfectly. Many people think they do NOT know English well enough (me being one of them when starting my career). Before engaging in any job interview, I suggest you test your English speaking skills with a native speaker. You can find them relatively cheap on Preply.</p>

    <p>You don't need a certification for English and my advice would be not to waste your time and money to obtain one. Communication skills are more important than grammar, and it's considered that you know English by default anyway. I was doing 1-on-1 lessons with native speakers for some time and after that, nobody ever questioned my ability to speak English nor did anyone ask for the certification. Ever.</p>

    <h2>A good resume</h2>

    <p>A good formatted one. You can look at my resume checklist <a title="Make Your Profile Attractive to Recruiters and HR Managers - George’s Quick Checklist" href="./georges-quick-checklist.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Specialization</h2>

    <p>For example, someone who worked only in one tech stack for 4 years will be worth more on the market than someone who did three different technologies for the same amount of time. Language agnostic? Could work, but I'll bet more on the specialized tech stack.</p>

    <h2>Commercial experience vs. personal project experience</h2>

    <p>Get to know everything and get to know everything on a commercial level.</p>

    <p>Commercial projects experience > Personal projects Experience.</p>

    <p>Keep this in mind. This doesn't mean that personal projects don't add to your experience. It just means that employers prefer to have your experience market-tested. And it counts for every kind of experience you have, too. From your primary dev tech stack to DevOps, QA, project management, team leading, etc.</p>

    <h2>Job hopping</h2>

    <p>As a rule of thumb, stay in one company for at least two years before you switch to the next one. Anything below 2 years in one company will be considered job hopping in the eyes of most HR managers in Germany.</p>

    <p>Again, the same story: if there's a person who spent the last 5 years in his/her current company and a person who changed three companies in 5-year period, I'm putting my bet on the former. The less the company changes, the better. Of course, if we're talking about startups, they need people as soon as possible so they'll be more flexible. But for an established company, it's all about stability.</p>

    <h2>Management experience</h2>

    <p>If you have any team leading/management experience make sure to put it on your resume and LinkedIn. Answer the following questions for anyone interested in your profile to have a better understanding of your skills:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How many people were on your team?</li>
      <li>What was your responsibility in your team?</li>
      <li>If you were a team leader, what was the technical structure of your team (e.g. how many backend developers, designers, DevOps engineers, etc.)? Do you have any customer-facing experience?</li>
      <li>Did you collaborate with other non-tech teams?</li>
      <li>Were you mentoring juniors at some point in time?</li>
      <li>Who were you reporting to?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every piece of information matters here. If you have this experience, it's a great addition to your profile and therefore your worth on the market. Make sure to have a presentation pitch of these skills ready when asked by a recruiter/HR manager.</p>

    <h2>DevOps and databases</h2>

    <p>Add everything to your resume as every single piece of information counts here also.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>DevOps: Kubernetes, Docker, Travis, AWS/Azure. Learn everything you can, everything.</li>
      <li>Databases: Get familiar with both SQL and NoSQL databases. That's your safe bet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The point is: the more stuff you know around sole software development, the better.</p>

    <h2>Internet connection and web camera</h2>

    <p>I cannot emphasize this enough. Please try to have a call from your home where you have a stable internet connection. Use the mobile internet over WiFi if necessary. Invest in a good web camera.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly, often even the internet connection of employers in Germany is bad. Add the lag on your side at the top of that and both parties get a poor experience. Sometimes I send a perfect candidate who gets rejected because the employer wasn't impressed with candidate's "online vibe". I would even have a test meeting with my friend before the interview on the same platform to get some feedback before the real thing.</p>

    <p>Do not overlook lighting in your room. Don't make it seem like you're calling from your basement. Note: <a title="Make Your Profile Attractive to Recruiters and HR Managers - George’s Quick Checklist" href="./communication-skills-and-ease-of-communication.html">Communication skills != Ease of communication</a>.</p>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>Just because it is obvious doesn't make it not important. And have enough people ignoring the obvious and you have an epidemic of bad experiences. Do your homework and you'll be light-years away from the competition.</p>
